I am an undergraduate research student at [National Tsing Hua University](http://nthu-en.web.nthu.edu.tw/bin/home.php),
majoring in Electrical Engineering. Though most of the lectures I took is EE-related, I’ve learned much more in my 
project. My research interest is to combine the different modality(including natural language and control signal) with
visual representation via machine learning. I’m also interested in reinforcement learning, and aspire to utilize 
the visual signal to build a better control and planning agent.

So far, I've been conducting research on image detection, image captioning, visual question answering, etc. My advisor 
is [Prof. Min Sun](http://aliensunmin.github.io/). Learn more in the  [Research Background[PDF]](https://andrewliao11.github.io/files/ResearchBackground.pdf)
